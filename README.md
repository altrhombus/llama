# The Llama

Welcome!

## Synopsis
The Llama is an easy way for admins and users alike to quickly get information about a computer.

## Description
The Llama originally started out as an application that grabbed the name of a computer and displayed it on the screen. It then turned into an application to learn how C# await/async worked, and also how to make an app look nice (using MahApps). Eventually it will help with learning how to make a proper MVC application. :)


### Prequisites

#### Dependencies
The Llama requires the .NET Framework 4.7.
If you're building the Llama from source, use Visual Studio 2017.

To grab hardware warranty information, this data will need to be populated in WMI prior to running the Llama.

## Notes
* This app makes use of the wonder mahapps.metro UI toolkit. Check it out at [http://mahapps.com/](http://mahapps.com/).
* The Llama icon was created by [Icojam at Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/Icojam).
